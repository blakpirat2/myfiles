<p class="p1"><span class="s1">"It ain't you, it's me" but the subtext </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">is that Alistair is not "alt" enough.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">a bit occultist + a bit traditionalist. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">don't simp for shit, i bear the cross as such</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Are you COVID cautious? Did my ho-ness cause this? </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Oh you "so exhausted", tryna spot the bluff</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It’s a full moon in your sun sign </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">so I'm pulled to the astrological stuff</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Like of course I should expect a Virgo </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">to judge me off some shit they already knew.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">"Connection was not affirming" </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">confirming an ending when I'm nowhere near ready to.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The universe had plans for you and me....</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">twenty two or three Joshua Tree...</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Like you never even heard me rap </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">but I guess that means that I’m not doing me.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">So is this what heartbreak feels like? </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It's been a minute for the Capricorn.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I wasn’t tryna be "hot and charming" </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">and push you out of your comfort zone.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">And if *not* alarming, well it's speaking ill</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">upon how you viewed my intentions for</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">all the time that we spent and the lines of consent</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">that you’re trying to hint I went and I colored alone</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">playing jokes with your nicknames </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">in the messages app to turn 'em blue</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">review the notes -- is it something I did </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">or the something you fear I might turn into?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I guess I just be having fun....</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">while people be having conundrums...</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Is that what compelled you to run? </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I guess I'll forever be wondering like...</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Man I know it’s my privilege (Damn, I know it’s a privilege)</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Man I know it’s my privilege (Damn, I know it’s a privilege)</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Man I know it’s my privilege (Damn, I know it’s a privilege)</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Man I know it’s my privilege (Damn I Damn I know it’s a privilege)</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Man I know it's my privilege (Damn-Da-Da Damn I know it's a privilege)</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Man I know it's my privilege (Damn Damn Damn I know)</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Man I know it's my privilege (Damn-Da-Da Damn I know)</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Man I know it's my privilege (Damn Damn Damn I know)</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This is for every time I was sick of someone </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">and just said instead that I was "too stressed"</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">And let the world around me just crumble humbly</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">get the hungry munchies, and accrue some debt</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">And pretend I'll never smile again </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">and never love anyone that isn't you</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">as if I wasn't talking to at least one or two </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">in some beautiful and new partnerships.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But honestly you can't change shit, </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">like I can't change the fact that I'm cis.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I get the urge to distance one's self </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">from whatever masculinity is.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">If truly this was an experiment </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">it would behoove you to publish the findings:</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">the Venn diagram of the 'Black' and the 'boy' </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">that had you all coy and smizing.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I'm thinking about all the fishermen who catch a prize </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">and toss em back with a hole in they face for their troubles.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">and the gender dysphoria present in getting banged from behind </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">and ate with a face full of stubble </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">by a nigga like me.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I almost asked for a book to read...</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I'll get one eventually just admit that you think that it's me.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">That's that secret extra virgin olive oil </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">drizzled on the Left Hand of Darkness</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">and me looking at our profiles thinking </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">nothing fucking changed so why you start this</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">and seeing the signs in astrology charts </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">that line the walls of my apartment</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I daydreamt that I would marry you </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">which I shared with you and then you hardened so...</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
