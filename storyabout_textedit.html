<p class="p1"><span class="s1">He tried “hello” first--</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">citing mutual friends.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Polite chatter, she expected the usual end--</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">for him to make this conversation an excuse to go in.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">He didn’t, kept listening, she’s getting used to him then…</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This is a story about a boy and his beautiful friend.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">About phone calls with her mom in the background chiming in</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">about expectations and givens</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">assumptions and walks</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">about mistakes and alcoholism</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">and Facebook and talks.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">About him listening too closely to things she had to say and taking heed--</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">naively thinking people say what they mean.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It’s about glances and legal adults in parks past midnight</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">about the chances he had over time but the parts didn’t fit right.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">About a spark not light right</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">a heart told “sit tight”.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Blushing brown cheeks when both asked</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“you hit or at least had a kiss, right?”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">And one big fight. About being drunk at a party.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">About it being hard to see her with him and he’s sorry.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">[should we hug or just..] walk on?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I can’t be your friend.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It’s about thirteen months passed--one of the coldest winters yet</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">but there’s a warm fire somewhere--</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">he seen smoke on the internet.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">She hit him out the blue,</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">a scene all-too-innocent.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">There was an awkward walk </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">they stopped twice </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">while he tried to light his cigarette.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">There’s an apology probably pretty moldy in her inbox.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">She’s like “man, honestly you told me to go kick rocks.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Acceptance of blame</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">admission of guilt</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">reminder of hurt.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Enough pain.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Friendship rebuilt.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Wonder how it’ll work.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A girl confessing a break-up</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">and a boy saying I know.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">An obligatory “don’t get ideas in your head though”--</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">so</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In an effort to respect the line</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">he figured it was about time</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">to get this chick up out his mind...</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">So on an overcast weekday</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">filled paint trays with pejoratives</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">and rolled her face away</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">with ‘man-eater’</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">‘groupie’ </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">and of course ‘bitch’.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">There was a “fuck it” </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">that meant something</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">as long as the echo lingered</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">plus the nervous tic of time</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">telling him where to point the finger--</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">At the past (he was fat and insecure)</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">At the present (time is passing and he’s growing more unsure)</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">And at the future (there’s a river. there’s a lake. there’s an ocean.)</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">And those words could only swim so far</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">so </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">so far they’re choking and they</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">drown</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">in a bottle at the bottom of the sea.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">He looks </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">down</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">a hollow reflection is all that he can see.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
