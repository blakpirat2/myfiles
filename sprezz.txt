[verse 1]
so i'm supposed to
Date Walter Payton's daughter-
be a prize winning author-
Doctor lawyer rocket scientist
a NASA astronaut or
carbon based copy of those that came before,
with a few new improvements for display in the stores?

we put the cart before the horse
the cow before the calf
be twice as good for the right to half
and make it look easy like my genius precedes me
no wonder there's comfort in cheating

so now I am rogue AI code with no tests to pass
Turing scenarios that reflect my past
a bundle of uneasy achieving and preening
no meaning, I mean, is this man even breathing?

my chest tight like the future is due
heart rate race pace like the end of mile 2

i didn’t get it out the mud
it’s intergenerational trauma that’s in my blood
that also been called love

[chorus]
i think i might be the elite     sprezzatura
so am I gonna be all I can be     sprezzatura
never gonna want to leave     sprezzatura
rest in peace     sprezzatura
yes indeed     sprezzatura
come on
x2

[verse 2]
so when you raised by a narcissist it makes you an enabler like
i am not a person I am merely extra clay for
the molding and unfolding of the wishes that existed
pre-existence of this kid its script's ambitious as is listless

and I might be a bishop but not a pawn for a king
i love my hobbit life,  i've seen the all Lord of the Rings
and i'm probably more a Gandalf than a knight with armor shining
because I wait and assess and strike with perfect timing

"you shall not pass" to "this too shall pass"
to radically accepting that it's true this life don't last cuz
I just wanna feel okay---what are you trying to do?
does a mountain just amount to just a climb and its view?

talented tenth or wasted talent and rent? madness and stress
obsessing over checking balance and debts,
g'home folks, it's a wrap on the set
we had it investigated and ain't found no advantages yet

[chorus]
i think i might be the elite     sprezzatura
so am I gonna be all I can be     sprezzatura
never gonna want to leave     sprezzatura
rest in peace     sprezzatura
yes indeed     sprezzatura
come on
