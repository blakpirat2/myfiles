<body>
<p class="p1">reformed ENFP, INFJ now</p>
<p class="p1">I guess I stay down like 'hey I'm thirty-eight now'</p>
<p class="p1">what a spectacular time for a nervous breakdown</p>
<p class="p1">from burnout and harassment I'm tryna reclaim my space now</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">new schedule in Google Sheets, let's see how long it lasts</p>
<p class="p1">if it should come to pass, that I fall on my ass</p>
<p class="p1">can I grasp that perfectionism ain't the point</p>
<p class="p1">and find some self-compassion for my innermost eight year old boy</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">mood journal missed again, gratitude practice is lacking</p>
<p class="p1">a dry erase pen and a napkin slay all of my dragons</p>
<p class="p1">a constant evaluation of habits</p>
<p class="p1">the motivation of this body breaking down and descending to blackness</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">I guess I'm finished with blending with average</p>
<p class="p1">cuz the pretending left an imprint, and now I'm limping and damaged</p>
<p class="p1">I've managed pretty well the panic on this sinking Titanic--<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1">the Tower tarot I've been handed? I'd say I've handled it well</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">that's a twelfth house Jupiter for my optimist boost</p>
<p class="p1">there's only so much "I'm a loser" that I'll give oxygen to</p>
<p class="p1">cuz I've pored over the pages and what we're not gonna do</p>
<p class="p1">is rewrite and gaslight and hype some optional truth</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">yo I was raised on fear and it's clear its had its effects</p>
<p class="p1">every three or so years it appears that I'll get depressed</p>
<p class="p1">and it stems from an aversion to failure, guilt, and regret</p>
<p class="p1">that makes me hide inside myself and reticent to express</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">it's anxiety --and I'm like "damn so I'm the last to see it?"</p>
<p class="p1">my body tried to fucking kill me so I would believe it</p>
<p class="p1">now I gotta treat it with self-care, but in earnest</p>
<p class="p1">honor what I want and what I need and therein: purpose</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">now I scratch the surface on this reward called a journey</p>
<p class="p1">tryna find blind spots--<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>thought I was grown when I turned thirty</p>
<p class="p1">luckily for me, sea-goats age like a bordeaux</p>
<p class="p1">so i'mma just keep on being me, but more so...</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">I used to white knuckle. Deflect with a light chuckle<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1">when a colleague predicted that I might buckle</p>
<p class="p1">I'm humbled now cuz I don't want no more smoke with the universe</p>
<p class="p1">and maybe I've expressed gratitude through this verse</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">and maybe in my truth I viewed passion as a curse</p>
<p class="p1">maybe I'll ||| honor that my words are worth the work</p>
<p class="p1">atomic bomb, or the sun could burst</p>
<p class="p1">atomic habits, like I wrote this first</p>
