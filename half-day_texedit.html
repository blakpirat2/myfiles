<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Lotta ideas -- should pursue some</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Lotta days you relive some and rue some</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I stepped out of the gruesome and even grew some</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">now i'm ready for whatever if something new come</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">this reminds of Pandora downtempo streams that I had on lock</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">the freestyles had more emotion than average hip-hop</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">spinning stories out of spit that hit the wind and then disappeared</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">until days go by weakly, all of a sudden it's been years.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">i'm getting older but it's fine. feeling divided against myself</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">my number is past its prime, it's mathematics all the time</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">like at what age am I failure? set a backwards clock</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">each tock and its tick is my private jailor</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">chart my success against my peers of similar nurture</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">despite extenuating circumstances i feel should i be further</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">but what is far? what is near? and where is there?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">and if i'm not quote "where i'm supposed to be", why do i care?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">why do I dare question the past's lessons?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">the rules of engagement? the lines of succession?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">i believe that we're the descendants of cowards</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">who ran away from war to make the rest of earth ours</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">who ran away from light because the stage has a power</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">who ran away from love 'cause it was caged in a tower</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Climb. I'm on my grind like bad brakes --</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">until I bounce up out of here into that light like this a half-day...</span></p>
