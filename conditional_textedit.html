<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Late August, first year between the 3-peats:</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">summoned to the kitchen, so I sauntered in meekly.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">My brother’s seventeen and in a couple more weeks he</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">is going off to college--I’mma take his room and TV.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I’m eight years old and what’s about to unfold</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">is a fission in the family vision that my father holds.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">He tossed my brother’s journal on the kitchen island,</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">looked at me and then my mom started crying.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Love is conditional.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I love when love is conditional.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I guess that love is conditional.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I love when love is conditional.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The four of us each a side of this rectangle.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The horror of "dad chooses argument’s best angle".</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The moral crux - Baptist religion and blessed angels.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The oral stuff my bro would not remove from the table.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Behind me out the window’s elevated CTA</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">while inside we went around in circles like a model train.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">My brother saying he wouldn’t rule about being gay,</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">my father turns to me pleading to agree that he can change.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Love’s conditional.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I love when love is conditional.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I’m thinking love is conditional.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I love when love is conditional.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Dropped him off at college, cut financial support.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Not much love until engaged (and to a woman, of course).</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">No matter misery or end in divorce--just happiness</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">the oldest son had seemed to straighten his course.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Re-married, had my nephew, but I’m still stuck in August</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Seeing shadows cast by trains passing and sparks coming off it.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">My next few years: the hardest. Marked the start of darkness.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Family thought it was because I was an artist. I learned</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Love is conditional.</span></p>
