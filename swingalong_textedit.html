<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">My father called his father a nigga. Said he'd urn him. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">I couldn't agree more. Preserve him.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Insurance policy pickup. Deposit put down.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Make the curve in the 'S' in our signature go round.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Swing along my family tree.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Never met uncle Alfonzio; he branched off to PCP.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Broke the thick front door glass--"Tom, I need some more cash".</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Gun in hand, my dad said "leave". When he didn't, he squeezed.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Didn't fire but that desire was aimed right at his heart.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Run for cover, my mother's lover would have blasted his brother apart.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">My brother's eleven in the next room wishing I would be quiet, but</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">I was terrible two laughing cause adults fighting is a riot,</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">like "Al, I was going to kill you, now listen you gotta go".</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">And I imagine what it's like when the smoke monster recedes in the night.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The two of them in a position that I'll never know.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Protecting my kids and my wife, willing to take my little brother's life.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">II.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">I see Junebug on Chicago from my girlfriend's car.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">He's with some crackhead chick and they're going up or coming down.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The only uncle I know. Banned from neighborhood bars.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Sent south to get clean. But bad news, he's back around.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">I see my uncle on Milwaukee while I'm picking up Plan B.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">He's way too in my business. Crusty-lipped and jaundiced.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">He wants us to go to the park so he can rap with me.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Says he's the last of the Mohicans. He can tell me about all this.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">So when I seen him on Damen, I wasn't saying much, I turned.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">My mom and I never let him in the house. Now it makes more sense.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">I know the look and smell of 'drunk as shit'. It's something I've learned.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">And every twist of that doorknob unlocks an event.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">So when I see him on Madison, dad in a funeral home,</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">He sings off-key, bear hugs me, tells me to have babies.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">He lost him mom half his life ago, now dad, he's alone.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">I try not to scoff at the birthday present of women's socks he gave me.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">III.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Intense labor. Long. Etta Mae, pushing out her first. Pain.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Only Slaughter daughter, oxygen deprived brain.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Cursed. Had stunted growth. Back in a hunch, sloped.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">I'm eight, answering phones. Can't understand her jumbled quotes.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">They decided high school not required. Who'd hire this invalid? </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Some guys still admired, interested.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Eyeing the disability check, deposited monthly.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Finally feeling, anything instead of ugly.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Can't count so self-esteem means a hefty amount.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Never had any trouble reading. So overall, she's beaming.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">And since ovary secretions still function semen seeped in.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">But being how it was then, no way, no baby, no husband.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">They told my mom to raise that baby boy alongside of me.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">My mom declined and he became the custody of Illinois.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">My aunt's in a low-functioning home somewhere in Skokie.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">I would imagine lonely, maybe her son could fill a void, if only. </span></p>
