<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Introduced me to the eighties movie potion juice.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Gluten free inflammatory message boards too.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">To the beauty inside of educating the minds of disenfranchised and struggling troubled youth.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The film industry, creative liberty, socialism, communist connected it to history.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The dark sense of humor. We were cool rather instantly but pressure can change, wax, and wane and alter chemistry.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Observant convert to your ministry -- your empathic natural passion is wizardry.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Unusual and beautiful, I had to have you get with me.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">An on-and-off friendship a few years, eventually...</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It was on like an independent movie scene:</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">        </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">        Vodka in the Slurpees and a walk through future memories--</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">        Concert on Milwaukee seems kinda like a distant dream--</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">        In a tent, on a deck, making out: bittersweet.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">And immediately, it got pretty Byzantine.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I lack boundaries, you buzz about like busy bees.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I haven't found me, and you have this tendency</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">to push and pull then descend into misery.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In my twenties, few things more important than sex to me</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">say you don't lack for the want but the energy</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">and I can't hotwire cars so it meant to me   </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">that you would always see me as a friend and you weren't into me.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Maybe it's the antidepressants.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Got you out of bed but zapped sexual essence.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Maybe it's my actual masculine presence and you lack an attraction and rather have a woman.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">You don't have a box to put in, a guy like me who will give you what you want instead of what you need.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">And give you what you need when you communicate a want and hold his tongue because he's used to being the one to hold shit up like</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I might be reincarnated as a rock, a bent evergreen or an ornate clock.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">What I mean is I'm content to stay locked in a place and hesitate to ever take stock.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">And you've got six years on me, needed me there</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">To be the one to reassure you when you're physically impaired</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">And when you learned of your disease and you were literally scared for your life--</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">couple puffs quit the cigarettes there.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Sometimes I fear I fucking ruined your life--</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">taking your entire thirties (not you as a wife).</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">And you might have saved mine (did you do with spite?):</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">demanded I get therapy and it produced some insight. [like]</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Rose just lies and she lets go of Jack. We were drowning and sharing an oxygen tank.</span></p>

<p class="p2"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Rose just floats there she lets go of Jack. We were drowning and sharing an oxygen tank</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We didn't know if the other one could swim if we sank. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We didn't know if the other one could swim if we sank.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We're texting right now as I write this in Evernote--scout's honor, hand to my heart like a stethoscope.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Best frenemies holding on to an endless rope, all that's left is hope, nothing else'll float.</span></p>
