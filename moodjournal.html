reformed ENFP, INFJ now
I guess I stay down like 'hey I'm thirty-eight now'
what a spectacular time for a nervous breakdown
from burnout and harassment I'm tryna reclaim my space now

new schedule in Google Sheets, let's see how long it lasts
if it should come to pass, that I fall on my ass
can I grasp that perfectionism ain't the point
and find some self-compassion for my innermost eight year old boy

mood journal missed again, gratitude practice is lacking
a dry erase pen and a napkin slay all of my dragons
a constant evaluation of habits
the motivation of this body breaking down and descending to blackness

I guess I'm finished with blending with average
cuz the pretending left an imprint, and now I'm limping and damaged
I've managed pretty well the panic on this sinking Titanic-- 
the Tower tarot I've been handed? I'd say I've handled it well

that's a twelfth house Jupiter for my optimist boost
there's only so much "I'm a loser" that I'll give oxygen to
cuz I've pored over the pages and what we're not gonna do
is rewrite and gaslight and hype some optional truth

yo I was raised on fear and it's clear its had its effects
every three or so years it appears that I'll get depressed
and it stems from an aversion to failure, guilt, and regret
that makes me hide inside myself and reticent to express

it's anxiety --and I'm like "damn so I'm the last to see it?"
my body tried to fucking kill me so I would believe it
now I gotta treat it with self-care, but in earnest
honor what I want and what I need and therein: purpose

now I scratch the surface on this reward called a journey
tryna find blind spots--  thought I was grown when I turned thirty
luckily for me, sea-goats age like a bordeaux
so i'mma just keep on being me, but more so...

I used to white knuckle. Deflect with a light chuckle 
when a colleague predicted that I might buckle
I'm humbled now cuz I don't want no more smoke with the universe
and maybe I've expressed gratitude through this verse

and maybe in my truth I viewed passion as a curse
maybe I'll ||| honor that my words are worth the work
atomic bomb, or the sun could burst
atomic habits, like I wrote this first
