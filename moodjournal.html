<body>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">reformed ENFP, INFJ now</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I guess I stay down like 'hey I'm thirty-eight now'</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">what a spectacular time for a nervous breakdown</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">from burnout and harassment I'm tryna reclaim my space now</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">new schedule in Google Sheets, let's see how long it lasts</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">if it should come to pass, that I fall on my ass</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">can I grasp that perfectionism ain't the point</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">and find some self-compassion for my innermost eight year old boy</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">mood journal missed again, gratitude practice is lacking</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">a dry erase pen and a napkin slay all of my dragons</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">a constant evaluation of habits</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">the motivation of this body breaking down and descending to blackness</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I guess I'm finished with blending with average</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">cuz the pretending left an imprint, and now I'm limping and damaged</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I've managed pretty well the panic on this sinking Titanic-- </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">the Tower tarot I've been handed? I'd say I've handled it well</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">that's a twelfth house Jupiter for my optimist boost</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">there's only so much "I'm a loser" that I'll give oxygen to</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">cuz I've pored over the pages and what we're not gonna do</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">is rewrite and gaslight and hype some optional truth</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">yo I was raised on fear and it's clear its had its effects</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">every three or so years it appears that I'll get depressed</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">and it stems from an aversion to failure, guilt, and regret</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">that makes me hide inside myself and reticent to express</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">it's anxiety --and I'm like "damn so I'm the last to see it?"</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">my body tried to fucking kill me so I would believe it</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">now I gotta treat it with self-care, but in earnest</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">honor what I want and what I need and therein: purpose</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">now I scratch the surface on this reward called a journey</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">tryna find blind spots--  thought I was grown when I turned thirty</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">luckily for me, sea-goats age like a bordeaux</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">so i'mma just keep on being me, but more so...</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I used to white knuckle. Deflect with a light chuckle </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">when a colleague predicted that I might buckle</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I'm humbled now cuz I don't want no more smoke with the universe</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">and maybe I've expressed gratitude through this verse</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">and maybe in my truth I viewed passion as a curse</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">maybe I'll ||| honor that my words are worth the work</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">atomic bomb, or the sun could burst</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">atomic habits, like I wrote this first</span></p>
