<p class="p1"><span class="s1">when i was sleeping they padded the place</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">with mirrors obscuring my path of escape</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">a chair and a tube television flicks on</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">and the voice of a god says go back to the tape</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">back to back to back to when eight </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">when I used to paint, when I used to draw</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">when I had it great, when I had it all</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">when something was coming to shake up the walls</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">when the blood started running</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">        (the tracking on this video is shit...)</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">and the love became a button</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">        (and i remember trying to use a joystick)</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">we had to choose sides, i was quick to grab Switzerland</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">mom chose omniscient man, dad picked the Heineken</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">brother bad timing in another month driving and</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">arriving in Ohio but declining hugs goodbye though</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I'm wondering like, why though? </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">we drove back, the folks so silent on the ride home</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Elyria, Lorain, passing by the windowpane</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">and i can tell right now is strange and it won't ever be the same</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">...................................I think it's 4th or 5th.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">must be 4th cuz I was born January '86</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">5th grade--I was on my R&amp;B shit</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">6th first thought about cutting up my wrists</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">same time I found out that writing was a gift</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Young Chicago Authors, just typed a bunch of shit</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">but the feelings and the form kinda formed into fit</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">and I felt infinitely better with a place for all of this</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">came home to find my story sitting on the kitchen counter</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">probably courtesy of a principal or a counselor</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">how it's no emergency that a kid is hinting about a</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">lot of pain and his attempt to escape i can't make sense out of</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">when the blood started flowing</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">     (i kinda wish the VCR would eat this tape)</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">they ask was I joking...</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">        or embellishing.... i tell em "yes" it's already too late</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">cuz the blood started coming</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">        (gotta watch your shoes when you're walking down a memory lane)</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">blood steady pumping</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">(.....................hold on, it's the train.)</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">inebriated father hella bothered making statements</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">bloodshot eyes can't surmise if I was gay yet</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">birds and the bees: said the birds were on some gay shit</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">the bees are weak-minded in search of instant gratification</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">"I don't know if you remember your brother’s a sodomite"</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I still recall the sticky still air of that August night</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">this nigga really thought he was building the Cosbys like,</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">in retrospect, it's reprehensible to try to copy, right?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">fast forward for some time now he's got a wife</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">i look around--so we forgot what went down? this cannot be life.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">never had to face it cuz he stayed with dating women</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">was it fear or just finding the men to have relationships with?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">i conjure up my inner child tell him embrace his victim</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">you deserved to grow before you'd known of any limits</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">you deserved to paint and draw, you deserved the space to fall</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">you deserved to take it all and make mistakes and stain the walls </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">with blood that was dripping</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">     from the ceiling it was pooling on the floor</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">cuz if nothing was different</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">    why'd our kitchen transition to a civil war?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">and if love's not a given</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">        what's the point of saying we're family for?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">for the cuts i never attempted</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">   i'mma paint with the blood that's on the floor.</span></p>
