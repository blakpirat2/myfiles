<p class="p1"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Ma's an aqua moon, Dad's a cap</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">I laugh like him</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Sometimes I can't stand them</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">and I know that I'm half them</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">I love grapes + pickles, like my mom when she was pregnant</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">I, with zero sense of irony, call things 'wonderful', my dad says it</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Me and him both love the drums</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">I heard him freestyle a pro-life verse once</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Some holidays we both get bummed</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">I like to host but with some attitude</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">then when I let loose, that's the biggest laughing I'll do</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">just like Ma and the smiling too</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Her frame, but his shell,</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">His brow, her cheeks,</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">His rough draft, her tweaks</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Early by three weeks</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Imperative I came out a Cap</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">twenty-nine degrees and some change</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">with Venus in the same place in its lap</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">So I love like it's a job, that I'm proud of</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">gives me self-respect, and that's probably</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">how come, I think of people</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">as boxes checked</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Not as in done, but like right for now, just 'all set'</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">and I stand guard outside the place until of course it all resets</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Friend zone plus all the sex, okay kinda yes</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">But I'm learning that it's not just 'do' but express too</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Claremont went up in flames and the plumes became adhesives</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Rae Jean thinks Cinderella, like one fella is decent</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The nigga she *had* lived with, had a wife, and he was cheating</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">On my mom, who was the girlfriend, with at least two side pieces</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">But we all have our flaws, maybe the trick is not to pedestal</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Or make it better by taking it with many grains of salt like a vegetable</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">so when my dad cheats and my mom just acts like it's inevitable</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">I guess it's all about our expectations and perspective too</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">They saw the same flames, survived them, then he gifts her first house</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">I hold the same flames that bind them hidden in my first house</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Aries intercepted right, on the ascendant turns out</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Pluto transiting Venus cazimi, I was meant to burn out</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">wow</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
